= Updating config.xml for Appery.io projects

This plugin updates `config.xml` for link:https://appery.io[Appery.io] projects
to set
`AllowInlineMediaPlayback` preference to `true`.
See https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.1.1/guide/platforms/ios/config.html

It also fixes the issue with Camera plugin configuration.
See https://docs.appery.io/docs/known-issues#section-camera-plugin-variables-for-ios-projects-

After exporting xCode sources you should also remove following lines from `config.xml`
to avoid a warning when uploading the app to App Store:

```
<key>UIApplicationExitsOnSuspend</key>
<false/>
```
